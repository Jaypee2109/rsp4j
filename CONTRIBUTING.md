# Contributing to RSP4J

Thank you for your interest in RSP4J!

## Getting Started

RSP4J's [open issues are here](https://github.com/streamreasoning/rsp4j/issues). An easy way to get started helping the
project is to *file an issue*. You can do that on the RSP4J issues page by clicking on the green button at the right.
Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated.

## Contributions

RSP4J welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to RSP4J should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core
contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the main tree or given feedback for changes
that would be required.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Fork the RSP4J project and create a new branch, push your changes and create a pull request. Make sure the project
  compiles and passes all tests. More information on create pull request can be
  found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit
  should compile and pass tests).

- Write documentation describing the functionality of new classes, interfaces or methods that do not inherit their
  functionality.

- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
